 #Introduction#
Once upon a time there lived a jolly old chef who lived in the tiny village of Honeycrisp.
Every morning, the chef would wake up at sunset and cook for all the other townspeople (or crisps as they call themselves).
Dazzeling teacakes, mouth-watering roasts, and even divine plum pudding. The chef's culinary expertise seemed near limitless.
All the townspeople loved the cheff, except for one very sour crisp.






Chef <name> owned a little resteraunt on top of hill which he also lived in.
Although his
So tired that he accidentially poured to much salt in one of his customers food.  
His customer was outraged and furiously marched out of the store.
Little did chef <Enter Name Here> know, but the furious customer was actually the renowned scientist Dr. Nefario!!
In order to spite the late chef, he snuck into the chef's room while he was sleeping and drugged the chef while he was sleeping.
Then, he sprinkled a magic salt on all the food and then quietly slipped away, dissapearing into the foggy night.
Food Comes Alive and becomes huge!

Objecive: Live while protecting the outside world in this crazy half-baked adventure.
