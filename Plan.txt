 #Introduction#
One day chef <Enter Name Here> was really tired. 
So tired that he accidentially poured to much salt in one of his customers food.  
His customer was outraged and furiously marched out of the store.
Little did chef <Enter Name Here> know, but the furious customer was actually the renowned scientist Dr. Nefario!!
In order to spite the late chef, he snuck into the chef's room while he was sleeping and drugged the chef while he was sleeping.
Then, he sprinkled a magic salt on all the food and then quietly slipped away, dissapearing into the foggy night.
Food Comes Alive and becomes huge!

Objecive: Live while protecting the outside world in this crazy half-baked adventure.
