 #Introduction#
Once upon a time there lived a jolly old chef who lived in the tiny village of Honeycrisp.
Every morning, chef <Enter name here> would wake up at sunset and cook for all the other townspeople (or crisps as they call themselves).
Dazzeling teacakes, mouth-watering roasts, and even divine plum pudding. The chef's culinary expertise seemed near limitless.
All the townspeople loved the cheff, except for one very sour crisp.
This bitter denizen was none other than the hated Dinkleberry, who also happened to be a chef.
Every day Dinkleberry would watch as crisp after crisp would gorge themselves at <Name>'s resteraunt, while he didn't even have a single customer.
So one night, Dinkleberry snuck out and bought a  powerful magic salt, known as "The Frost", from a passerby witch.
He then broke into <Name>'s resteraunt and poured the salt on all of his ingredients.
The Next morning when <Name> woke up, he found himself about to be eaten by two Giant Carrots!!!
He dashed out into the main room, only to find that all his ingredients had grown huge and hungry for some crisps.
Luckily the chef knew this day would come....

Can u defeat the "Frosted Ingredients" and help take back the resteraunt before all of Honeycrisp gets eaten to the very core?
